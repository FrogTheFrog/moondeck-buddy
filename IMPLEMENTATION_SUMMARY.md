# Implementation Summary

## Environment Variable Forwarding for MoonDeck Buddy

I have successfully implemented a system to capture environment variables starting with "APOLLO*" or "SUNSHINE*" from MoonDeckStream.exe and forward them to MoonDeckBuddy.exe for use when launching games.

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **NEW: `src/lib/utils/include/utils/envsharedmemory.h`**
   - Header file for the EnvSharedMemory class
   - Defines the interface for shared memory environment variable transfer

2. **NEW: `src/lib/utils/envsharedmemory.cpp`**
   - Implementation of the EnvSharedMemory class
   - Handles serialization, shared memory management, and data validation
   - Includes robust error handling and logging

3. **MODIFIED: `src/stream/main.cpp`**
   - Added environment variable capture on Stream application startup
   - Added cleanup on application exit
   - Includes the new EnvSharedMemory functionality

4. **MODIFIED: `src/lib/os/steamhandler.cpp`**
   - Modified `executeDetached()` function to accept environment variables
   - Updated `launchSteam()` method to use environment variables when launching Steam
   - Updated `launchApp()` method to use environment variables when launching games
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

5. **NEW: `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`**
   - Documentation explaining the feature and how it works

6. **NEW: `test_envsharedmemory.cpp`**
   - Test program to verify the shared memory functionality (for development/testing)

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Automatic Environment Variable Capture**
   - Stream application automatically captures APOLLO* and SUNSHINE* environment variables
   - No manual configuration required

2. **Shared Memory Communication**
   - Uses Qt's QSharedMemory for inter-process communication
   - Includes data validation with versioning and checksums
   - Thread-safe with mutex protection

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of missing shared memory
   - Data validation to prevent corruption
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

4. **Steam Integration**
   - Environment variables are applied when launching Steam itself
   - Environment variables are applied when launching individual games
   - Works with both Big Picture mode and desktop Steam

5. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic cleanup on application exit
   - Size limits to prevent memory issues (64KB max)
   - Proper shared memory lifecycle management

### How It Works:

1. **Stream Phase**: When MoonDeckStream.exe starts:
   - Scans system environment for variables starting with "APOLLO" or "SUNSHINE"
   - Serializes them into shared memory
   - Maintains shared memory until application exits

2. **Game Launch Phase**: When MoonDeckBuddy.exe launches Steam/games:
   - Retrieves environment variables from shared memory
   - Applies them to the Steam/game process environment
   - Logs the activity for debugging

3. **Cleanup Phase**: When Stream application exits:
   - Automatically clears the shared memory
   - Ensures no memory leaks

### Dependencies:

- The implementation uses existing Qt libraries (QSharedMemory, QProcessEnvironment, etc.)
- No new external dependencies required
- Compatible with the existing CMake build system

### Testing:

- Created a test program to verify shared memory functionality
- Includes comprehensive logging for runtime debugging
- Error handling covers edge cases and failure scenarios

This implementation provides a robust, automatic solution for forwarding environment variables from streaming context to game launch context, which should work seamlessly with APOLLO and SUNSHINE streaming setups.
